# Cobalt Modifications (Public)
Public version of CobaltModifications featuring only snippets instead of whole files of bugfixes and suggested modifications to Cobalt (2016) by [Oxeye Game Studio](http://www.oxeyegames.com/)

Files are named after the file meant to be modified under Cobalt/daisyMoon. Where snippets should be placed is designated by comments.

> [!NOTE]  
> This is an **incomplete** list of fixes; there's known bugs that are still in the process of being fixed or being fixed properly, and modifications that are still WIP

I take no responsibility for anything breaking.

### Contributions

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you want to contribute, you _must_ explain each change you made, both what it does, and why the change was made.
> You must also ensure you wrap your modified, added, or removed code with something like `-- NON-DEVELOPER EDIT` and `-- NON-DEVELOPER EDIT END` for easy identification.

Changes, but _especially_ bugfixes, must strive to change as little as possible, and must make as much sense as possible. Measure twice, ~~cut~~ write once. Be sure to explain what the bug _is_ as well.
