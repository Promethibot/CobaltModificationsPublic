# Wishlist
Desired features for the game. Meant to be editor stuff mostly and less item/hull suggestions. If there's enough demand for the latter, it will get its own section for readability.

## Major
- Easy sharing/opening of custom stories
    - Easy customization of memory.lua and colors.lua to this end
- Officially enabling the adventure editor
- Editor auto-backups; see implementation under stageEdit.lua in SuggestedModifications

## QoL
- Restarting chapters mid-chapter

## Miscellaneous
- Destructive painting
